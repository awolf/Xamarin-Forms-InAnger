# Xamarin-Forms-InAnger
Are you a skeptic of the promise of Xamarin.Forms? Do you believe that with Xamarin.Forms you can build native cross-platform UI’s with a single C# codebase? Early on I struggled with the choice of whether to use Xamarin.Forms or a combination of Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android.

## On the Xamarin.Forms Fence

To be completely honest, I am no longer a Xamarin.Forms skeptic, but, I do have some reservations about its ability to make good looking cross-platform UI’s. I know that Xamarin.Forms can make developer level UI’s. You know what I mean; it works — but its ugly!

What can a design conscious developer do when faced with the possibility of a bad UI? Scream? Run away? Move to HTML5? No, that won’t do. It’s time to get angry and swing Xamarin.Forms with all our might.
